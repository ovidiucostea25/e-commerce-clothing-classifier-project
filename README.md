# e-commerce-clothing-classifier-project
Automate e-commerce processes with image classification.

Project description:
Transform the retail industry with cutting-edge AI: develop an clothing classification model to create a smarter, more efficient shopping experience.
The model should be capable of accurately categorizing images of clothing items into distinct garment types such as shirts, trousers, shoes, etc.

Project steps:
1. Define the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
   - Create a class containing all the appropriate layers, and a method to perform the forward pass of a batch of images.
3. Train the CNN
   - Create a training loop that loops over the dataset, calculating the loss and propagating it backwards through the network.
5. Test the CNN
   - Use the trained model to classify the images in the test set, and calculate the appropriate metrics.
